# Incs870-Spring
Spring Boot is the back-end framework that handles front-end requests and major business logic. With WebSocket technology, a persistent bidirectional connection is established to achieve real-time communication, ensuring that the system can transmit data in real time, which greatly improves the user experience, especially in situations requiring real-time updates and interactivity.
